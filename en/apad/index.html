. <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 118</em>(51).</li>
</ol>
<p>I skimmed through this paper.</p>
<p>The authors used math models and simulations to study whether proposal-based (ex ante) peer review and outcome-based (ex post) peer review lead to different questions that scientists decide to study. The authors find that ex ante peer review makes scientists less likely to pursue risky questions whereas ex post peer review encourages risky questions.</p>
<p>To promote open science, there is a movement in the scientific community to let researchers submit proposals to journals before they start their study. Journals decide whether to accept it based on the proposals, not the results. This practice encourages open science and deters p-hacking. On the other hand, as this paper argues, it might also make researchers less likely to pursue risky projects.</p>
<p><div class=info>
I am wondering whether we can study the differences between the two modes of peer review through experiments.

<p>The authors analyzed word frequencies in Google nGram data covering books from 1850 to 2019. They find that relative to sentiment words, frequency of rationality-related words increased from 1850 to the end of 20th century. Then frequency of rationality-related words decreased relative to sentiment words. This pattern is also observed in the New York Times corpra. Since 2004, Google search query results show similar patterns.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>Menstrual irregularity makes detection of pregnancy harder. Using data from a commercial app where people can record menstrual cycles, the authors of this paper find that those people have higher risks for irregular menstrual cycles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those who report polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), diabetes, obesity, etc</li>
<li>Hispanic women</li>
</ul>
<p>In some states, laws disallow abortion after the dection of fetel &ldquo;hearbeat&rdquo;, which usually occurs 6 weeks after the last menstruation. To be eligible for abortion, people need to detect pregnancy early one. However, the earliest symptoms of pregnancy&ndash;irregular menstruation&ndash;is missed, especially for those who have irregular menstrual cycles.</p>

<p>The authors matched people based on non-political similarities. A matched group might have similar or different political stances. In each matched group, one person read a short and argumentative essay about wealth redistribution in the US. The authors want to see how similarity in non-political interests (high, and low), political stances (high similarity, and low similarity), and the interactions between the two variables, influenced opinion updates. I feel the study is very complicated.</p>
<p>Major findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The increase caused by reading an essay by a matched person in favor of redistribution is higher than the decrease caused by reading an essay by a matched person against redistribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Polarization for participants with mild views decreased regardless of their matched person&rsquo;s political stance whereas participants holding strong views became more extreme if they were in the &ldquo;same stance&rdquo; group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feelings of closeness are associated with greater belief updates. This effect of closeness is smaller for those with extreme opinions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interaction with people with different opinions decreased closeness; Interaction with people with similar opinions increased closeness. The decrease is greater than the increase.</p>

The compared replies before and after the 280-character limit change from the perspective of linguistic features, such as incivility, politeness, respect, etc. The results show that doubling the number of characters allowed in a tweet made the political discussions less uncivil and more deliberate.

<p>The results show that (1) after Google moved its server from Mainland China to Hong Kong, its results are as inaccessible, if not more, as those of Baidu, partly due to the Great Firewall and bad links; (2) The results of Google and Baidu are very different, with a very low overlapping rate and different rankings; (3) Baidu&rsquo;s results are biased towards its own services (i.e., against its competitors like Hudong Baike).</p>

<p>The authors presented moving pictures, i.e., a short film to three groups of female undergraduate students. The film consists of movements of three objects: a large triangle, a small triangle, and a small circle. There is also a rectangle that can be opened and closed. This rectangle does not move.</p>
<p>The first group of students simply watched this film and were asked to describe it. The second group watched it and were asked to interpret movements as those of persons. The third group had the same instructions as the second one; the only difference is that they watched the film in reverse.</p>
<p>The results show that no matter whether participants were told to interpret the movements as those of persons&rsquo;, they almost all tended to do so. The authors argue that as soon as we consider moving objects as persons, &ldquo;perception of motive or need is involved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is a very cool study. The authors were interested in whether free Wi-Fi offered by restaurants increased the incidents of quality-of-life crime reporting, and how that increase (if there is one) interacts with race and income.</p>
<p>The authors then collected data (restaurants with free Wi-Fi, and crime records) of Chicago. Their analysis shows that free Wi-Fi does not lead to an increase in quality-of-life policing. However, it does lead to an increase in affluent areas, and White areas, but not in poorer areas and non-White areas.</p>

<p>This is very interesting and meaningful work! The authors first gathered and summarized major guidelines for alternative text (alt text). The authors pointed out that these guidelines do not provide empirical evidence of their rationale.</p>
<p>The authors then went on collecting visualizations from news websites and surprisingly found that none of them include alt texts. Then they turned to scientific visualizations on publications of IEEE Vis, ACM ASSETS, and ACM CHI.</p>
<p>In the second phase of the study, the authors interviewed 21 blind people and 1 person with low vision. Each participant saw four visualizations without alt texts and was asked to describe what they found. Later, they were given the alt texts.</p>
<p>Based on the interview, the authors found that blind people tend to visualize in their head when they interact with visualizations. Therefore, providing necessary information, such as chart type, color, axes, etc, can relieve their cognitive burden when constructing a mental image of the visualization.</p>
<p>The authors then provided guidelines for alt text generation based on their interview results.</p>
<p><div class=info>
I am wondering how blind people interact with interactive visualizations.

<p>This news piece talks about remote sensing. Satellites, planes, drones, etc, can capture sunlight reflected off tree leaves. These data can be used to measure five of the six essential biodiversity variables (EBVs): species by color, tree height, diversity maps, land cover, and usage. Remote sensing has also been used to monitor animals, for example, birds and penguins.</p>
<p>When combined with ground measurements, remote sensing can be more powerful and accurate. For example, a team from Yale University is building computer models based on both remote sensing data and ground measurements, for example, climate and vegetation. These models can be used to predict the location where a given animal species can be found.</p>

<p>Using mobility data (from SafeGraph) of 90 million people in the USA, the authors predicted infection cases with a simple susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model. The model was able to predict the evolution of daily confirmed cases in ten large cities of the USA from early March to early May, despite the changing policies and changing human behavior during this period.</p>
<p>The model confirmed that people from disadvantaged groups in terms of racial and income are more vulnerable to COVID infections. This is because they visited denser locations and stayed longer. This finding has important implications for public policies. As cities are thinking of reopening, governments can implement policies helping reduce infection rates in low-income areas.</p>

. <em>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, 23</em>(1), 771-780.</p>
<p>I skimmed through this paper.</p>
<p>This paper employed co-word analysis to analyze keywords in IEEE Vis papers from 1990 to 2015. In terms of IEEE Vis, there are two types of keywords: those appeared in actual papers in PDF, and those appeared on IEEE Xplore website. The difference is that authors are free to decide their own keywords and put them in their papers, but when they submit their paper on IEEE Vis platform, they have to choose from keywords already defined by IEEE Vis. The second type is called PCS keywords. Based on these two types of keywords, the authors manually created <strong>topics</strong>.</p>
<p>This paper is mainly about two questions: (1) what are the key themes among IEEE Vis papers and what are the relationships among them; (2) how do certain keywords emerge and evolve.</p>
<p>Later, the authors analyzed &ldquo;topic-coded keywords&rdquo; and PCS keywords from two perspectives: cluster (how they cluster), and networks (how they relate to each other). The results indicated that topic keywords lack mainstream topics but PCS keywords have mainstream topics.</p>
<p>The authors also mentioned that keywords inputted by paper authors have unnecessary duplicates, for example, singular vs. plural. This is not helpful. The authors also mentioned a fixed list of keywords. But this list is always evolving and it&rsquo;s a good question to ask whether we can automate the updating process.</p>
<p>keyvis.org is one of the outputs of this paper where people can search keywords appearing in IEEE Vis papers.</p>

<p>Hangartner, D., Kopp, D., & Siegenthaler, M. (2021). Monitoring hiring discrimination through online recruitment platforms. <em>Nature, 589</em>(7843), 572-576.</p>
<p>This paper traces the searching and browsing behavior of Swiss recruiters on the public recruiting platform. The analyses based on the rich data show that (1) there is apparent discrimination based on ethinicity in terms of the contact likelihood and time spent on viewing the profile; (2) overall, there is no sign of discrimination based on gender but there is variation across different occupations.</p>

The result will be a modest decrease in energy consumption. It should be noted that the paper fails to include some important factors in their model. For example, the price of air conditioning or electricity might decrease.</p>

This study comes to this conclusion after using machine learning to analyze 6 million YouTube videos from 144 countries around the world. The article in the end shows some methodological flaws in the study, for example, there is no validation that the facial expression annotated by the human rater is in fact what the person in the video is experiencing, and the annotations are made only in English. Nonetheless, this paper opens up new methodological possibilities for similar studies in the future.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Insufficient quality of measurements</p>
<ul>
<li>Measurement models: tie theoretical constructs to observable data</li>
<li>In social sciences, the constructs we are measuring, predicting, and explaining are unstable and they are influenced by the mere act of measuring, predicting, or explaining.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The consequence of mis-measurements</p>
<ul>
<li>There might be a mismatch between the theoretical understanding of a construct and the measurement: what we measure is not what we want to measure</li>
<li>How to anticipate the side effects of measurements in this &ldquo;algorithmically-infused society&rdquo;?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The limits of existing social theories</p>
<ul>
<li>We need theories explaining the role of algorithms in societies.</li>
<li>In social sciences, should research be theory-driven or data-driven? This is a question.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=solutions>Solutions<a href=#solutions class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Possible solutions to above three problems: (1) develop <strong>responsible</strong> and <strong>trustworthy</strong> models for measurement; (2) mitigate negative effects of mismeasurements; and (3) develop &ldquo;empirically informed theories&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to improve measurements</p>
<ol>
<li>Use different from different sources (e.g., self-report, mobile phone apps, experimental data, etc)</li>
<li>Have good guidelines. For example, to document, develop, and maintain measurement models.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Measurement itself may affect the outcome. For example, ranking of popularity influences popularity itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Responsible social science agenda</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the measurements &ldquo;just and equitable&rdquo;, &ldquo;transparent and interpretable&rdquo;, and &ldquo;privacy preserving&rdquo;?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To integrate data and measurements in theory-building might be beneficial. This is more so at algorithmically infused societies where new phenomena emerge frequently which requires theories to be updated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to avoid &ldquo;black box measurement models&rdquo; which rely on unjustifiable assumptions, inaccurate logic and biased data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to consider the potential consequences of measurements. These consequences might affect individuals and societies, and might also be hard to identify and quantify.</p>

. <em>Nature News, 551</em>(7679), 159.</p>
<p>I like this piece. I believe some of the concerns brought up in it will be real.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Privacy. Neural data is so personal. Imagine a hacker hijacking the BCI system you are using, &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; all of the thoughts and emotions you had since your childhood. He will know more about you than anybody in the world. I agree with the suggestion that access and sale of personal neural data be strictly regulated, much like sale of human organs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identity. This is a very pressing concern. Imagine your brain is connected with many others. You don&rsquo;t even know which thought is yours. Then it&rsquo;s natural you lose your sense of identity. This can be spiritually enlightening or psychologically devastating, depending on your reaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Augmentation. It&rsquo;s so easy to have an &ldquo;augmentation arm race&rdquo;: people, or even countries, augment their abilities through nanotechnologies. This will exacerbate social inequality.</p>
</li>

<p>The authors study the characteristics of Twitter users susceptible to social bots based on the data from Social Bot Challenge 2011. They find that susceptible users interact with more users (have a high out-degree), and tend to use Twitter for a conversational purpose rather than for an informational one.</p>
<p>The study is also very limited. For example, all the users had an interest in or had retweeted about <em>cats</em>. In addition, the dataset is too small: only around 400 users (76 susceptible and 298 non-susceptible). But I like this paper: it is short and clear.</p>

<p>I skimmed through this paper.</p>
<p>This paper is about how algorithmic decisions affect people&rsquo;s perceptions of justice. The study finds that people consider justice-related issues when they encounter decisions made by algorithms. The study also finds that explanations may or may not affect how people feel about the fairness of the decisions, depending on the scenarios. The authors conclude that there might be no best approach to explaining algorithmic decisions.</p>

<p>Google and its thousands of developers around the world have been using one single monolithic repository which contains one billion files and 35 million commits. Google used tools like Piper and CitC (Clinetns in the Cloud) to support using one monolithic repository.</p>
<p>Using a monolithic repository has benefits such as encouraging collaboration and easier dependency management. The drawbacks are that it requires investment to support such a huge repository and the codebase might become too complicated. However, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks and that&rsquo;s why Google is not interested in splitting the repository.</p>

<p>Abhraneel&rsquo;s study tries to compare insights (operationalized as <em>recall</em> and <em>comprehension</em>) users obtain from visualizations with narratives and with interactivity (there are four conditions, see Fig. 1 on p.9). The results show narratives have weak effects and interactivity has barely any effects. The conclusion is that interactivity may not be a necessary component of information visualizations. This, however, by no means means that interactivity is always useless.</p>

<p>I skimmed through the whole book. Some suggestions I bore in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t let graduate school kill your personal time. You need an adequate amount of sleep. You need to eat and drink well. You need to have a personal life.</li>
<li>Especially in the first year, if you want to collaborate with two different professors, make sure to let them know. Otherwise, one of them will be surprised if you decline the opportunity to work with him/her. (p73)</li>
<li>Set aside time each day, at least each week, for writing. Do it even though you don&rsquo;t feel like doing it that day/week.</li>
<li>Write one co-authored paper and one solo-authored paper each year in the first two years of your PhD.</li>
<li>Mentorship is better than apprenticeship. The first means you work with more than one advisor to develop your own research agenda whereas the second means you work for only one advisor on his/her research project.</li>
<li>Practice your research talk! You definitely need practice.</li>
<li><em>R</em> is good!</li>
</ul>
<p><div class=info>
I disagree with Tom&rsquo;s suggestions about websites (p.70). Tom says it is not very useful if you have a professional website at the start of your PhD as you don&rsquo;t have much stuff to put on it. Rather, he suggests a website at the end of PhD when you are looking for a job.</p>
<p>I highly disagree with it. In my opinion, <strong>a homepage is much more than your CV</strong>. Yes, you might not have papers to put on your homepage, but there are millions of other things you can put. Write blogs! Document your daily tangible progress! Publish your projects! Introduce yourself! These activities will (1) let you know what you lack, and (2) motivate you to make progress each and every day.</p>
<p>Again, your homepage is more than your CV!

<li>You have to figure out on your own why your work is important.</li>
<li>Never expect your thesis to be perfect. There is no perfect thesis.</li>
<li>Be open to job opportunities outside of your PhD. This prevents you from losing your independence. If you know you have other options outside of your research, you are better off.</li>
<li>Avoid taking lectures.

. <em>Nature, 534</em>(7609), 684-687.</p>
<p>The authors examined the relationship between (1) the degree of interdisciplinarity of research proposals and (2) the success rate of this proposal being approved of.</p>
<p>The dataset consists of all proposals, both successful and unsuccessful, submitted to the Australian Research Council Discovery Programme from 2010 to 2014.</p>
<p>Success rate is easy to calculate but &ldquo;interdisciplinarity&rdquo; of a proposal is not. Researchers used to measure &ldquo;interdisciplinarity&rdquo; by checking specific words like &ldquo;interdisciplinary&rdquo; or through bibliometric analysis. These two measures have many disadvantages. The authors here propose a new measure called interdisciplinary distance (IDD).</p>
<p>The results show that interdisciplinary proposals have lower success rates and this is not because universities with higher success rates submit more narrowly focused research proposals.</p>

<p>The authors used a machine learning model (logistic regression) to identify Russian Troll Twitter accounts based on the dataset released by Twitter of potential Troll accounts. This model is able to distinguish troll accounts from randomly selected Twitter accounts with good precision. Adjusted by human verification, the authors argue that around 2.6% of examined accounts on Twitter are Russian Troll accounts.</p>

</p>
<ol>
<li>Read broadly.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Look beyond your immediate interest. Papers that connect different topics and even different fields are insightful.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s better to read 10 papers superficially than to read one paper in depth. With a paper management system, you can always go back and read more deeply.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=2>
<li>
<p>Work on two things.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you only have one project in hand, then : 1) when the project fails, you lose motivation; 2) when the project comes to a standstill, you have no choice but to keep grinding. In comparison, if you have two projects, you can work on the other one if one project is stagnant, which gives you a rest and maybe a new perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the two projects are in different fields, then it&rsquo;s better to focus on one project a day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be ambitious.</p>
<p>When you have two projects going on, one can be a safe one and you can take risks with the other one. The risky one might have more impact if it succeeds. Work on something that excites you. Challenge the status quo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you collaborate with others remotely, it&rsquo;s important to &ldquo;communicate clearly and to set expectations&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be open in terms of collaboration. Work with something different than your supervisor. Collaborate with people from a different university than your own.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be proactive.</p>
<p>Seek out collaborations, meetings, and advice actively. Talk with people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a blog.</p>
<p>Writing a blog helps you develop your communication skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep a source of positive energy.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Work on things that excite you. If you cannot decide things to work on, try to find an angle that excites you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish a support network that you can count on. Surround yourself with positive people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find something that you can fall back on when things don&rsquo;t go well: exercise, a side project, meditation, blogging, to name just a few. Always remember that your well-being is the single most important thing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play to your strengths.</p>
<p>This section is very inspiring for me personally. I come from a non-CS background and should use this as a strength. A different perspective on and/or approach towards problems is my strength.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intern or visit a university.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are deciding between the industry and academia, an internship or a research visit can give you insights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Working with a mentor different from your advisor can help you grow.</p>
</li>

<p>👍 Liu, L., Wang, Y., Sinatra, R., Giles, C. L., Song, C., & Wang, D. (2018). <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0315-8 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Hot streaks in artistic, cultural, and scientific careers</a>
. <em>Nature, 559</em>(7714), 396-399.</p>
<p>This paper is significant because it reconciles two opposing models of individuals' career productivity. The first model is the &ldquo;Matthew effect&rdquo; which believes that there is a unique period when a person performs consistently better than in other periods. The second model argues that the best work is purely random and is driven by high productivity.</p>
<p>The hot-streak model proposed by this paper argues that peak-performance period occurs randomly in a person&rsquo;s career, but high-impact work is more likely to occur during this hot-streak period.</p>
<p>The study begins by investigating the probability of each of the three most impactful work (<code>$N*$</code>, <code>$N**$</code>, and <code>$N***$</code>) by an artist, film director, and a scientist and finds that each of the three works by an individual occurs randomly. But when the authors looked at the distance between individuals' most impactful work, they found that high-impact work tends to occur together. That is to say, there is a temporal correlation between highly impactful work for an individual.</p>
<p>Some other key findings in this paper:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All three careers, i.e., artists, directors, and scientists have peak-performance periods, but the hot-streak pattern varies across careers. See Figure 2 for details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hot streaks rarely happen more than once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the three careers considered in this paper, a hot streak usually lasts 3-6 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are not more productive during a hot streak period.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Social scientists focus on explanations that are often for causal relationships derived from theories. Computer scientists, on the other hand, emphasize predictions. As long as a model improves predictions, computer scientists is Okay with the model being super complex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What NHST, a method applied widely in social science research, does is that it tests whether the hypothesized effect derived from theories is not zero. If it is not zero, then researchers conclude these observations are not in conflict with the theory, so the theory can continue to be used as an explanatory tool.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, NHST has the following flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>NHST does not test directly the outcome of interest, nor the magnitude of effect. It only looks at whether the hypothesized effect based on a theory is non-zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In reality, many effects are non-zero. Therefore, statements that a theory cannot be ruled out by data are not valid as they appear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computer scientists use models to predict. It should be noted that the value of a model does not only depend on its absolute performance, but also its comparison with a baseline. For example, search data is highly correlated with flu numbers two weeks later, which is quite impressive. But it turns out that the same correlation can be found between CDC case numbers in previous weeks, and case numbers in future weeks.</p>

<p>This paper analyzed audiences' log data from three interactive visualizations authored by Idyll, a markup language to create interactive content.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>My main takeaways from this papers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>People usually spend around 1-2 minutes on a visualization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If some contents are hidden behind a click, around half of the people will not click and see it. Maybe they don&rsquo;t notice it or they are satisfied with high level information enough to skip details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many people will quickly skim through all the content before they dive into details (if they ever do so).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How I can further this work:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The function of accessing users' log data is restricted to visualizations made by the Idyll language. However, most interactive visualizations available online might be created by other languages. This means we cannot use this feature to study interactive visualizations in the wild.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am thinking of a study where I ask participants to interact with many interactive visualizations and look at what features of visualizations (1) make people spend more time and (2) lead to better recall.</p>

<p>I skimmed through this paper.</p>
<p>This study is a twin study. It shows that using cannabis during adolescence has a possible causal relationship with young adults' socioeconomic outcomes. However, cannabis use is no longer associated with negative emotional and cognitive outcomes once we consider familial factors.</p>

<p>I skimmed through this paper. The authors use machine learning theories to model how people form beliefs. This approach is different from the Bayesian one. A Bayesian model of human learning posits that people have a prior and update this distribution based on new data. An ML approach, on the other hand, allows people to discard one prior for another when the old one fails to explain the data.</p>

<p>Instrumental rationale of diversity: diversity brings educational benefits.</p>
<p>Moral rationale: diversity involves intrinsic values such as justice.</p>
<p>White participants (students & caregivers) prefer and expect more positive outcomes at instrumentally motivated universities compared to moral motivated ones. Black participants prefer and expect the opposite. University admission officers are aware of, and share these preference and expectation differences.</p>
<p>Both texts from the official websites of universities and admission officers show that universities use instrumental rationales to a greater extent than moral ones.</p>
<p>Regression models show that when texts from official websites show low morality, high instrumentality correlates with worse graduation rates for Black students.</p>
<p>The results of this study show that the common practice of diversity among universities favor White Americans rather than racial minorities.</p>

<p>The authors use a classifier to identify investigative reporting, and measure how investigativeness they are, among 5.9 million articles in the past 10 decade (2010-2020) produced by a selection of 50 newspapers located in different regions of the US. They find that despite the widespread changes recently in the news industry, the quality of investigative reporting in US local newspapers was stable. That said, there is a decline in the past two years, possibly because of newsroom layoffs.</p>

<p>They find that when people are experiencing stress, their blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic) will be significantly higher than their baseline level. Resources people have to cope with stresses, such as financial, and interpersonal networks, have a role here as well. The more resources people have, the lower their blood pressure will be when experiencing stress.</p>

<p>The authors used nighttime light (NTL) which is remotely sensed as a proxy for economic inequality across and within countries in the world. As can be seen in Fig. 1A and 1B, light Gini estimate (2010) almost overlaps with income Gini estimate (2010). Statistical analysis also shows that light Gini for high income countries is significantly lower than that for low and middle income nations.</p>
<p>Finer resolutions of NTL shows that the areas with high inequality are: eastern China, Southern Africa, coastal areas of the USA (e.g., California and Texas), northern Egypt, and central Brazil.</p>

I understand why the hedge fund manager (end of p. 18) believes he deserves the money: those who excel get more money. This idea makes sense when you only look at the &ldquo;market&rdquo; you are in. But when you look at the world from above, you will realize that the reason why you can be successful and earn so much money is not because you are hardworking (there are millions of people who are more hardworking than you are but failed); It&rsquo;s because many others have helped you in one way or another and you are simply lucky. The moment you look down upon a poor man as not as hardworking as you are, you misunderstand how the world works.

<p>The authors analyzed 14 million books (Google Books) in English (US), German, and Spanish in 125 years (1855-2019) based on the prevalence of labeled cognitive distortion schemata (CDS) language patterns. As Fig. 2 shows, the prevalence of CDS language markers is much higher nowadays than 100 years ago. The increase starting from 2007/2008 is very obvious.</p>
<p>I am wondering whether the results are due to artifacts. In the past, the elite few were the sources of the authors. Nowadays, it&rsquo;s becoming more common for ordinary people to publish. Therefore, books in the past were not good indicators of the general public. That said, this is a very impressive study. Since the data is freely available online for everyone, I can no longer use &ldquo;lack of data&rdquo; as an excuse for not being able to publish high quality research.</p>

<p>Experiment 2:</p>

<li>
<p>In the world we live now, people focus on results. Social media exacerbates the problem because people only share with others their results and highlights in life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ture long-term thinking does not involve goals. Goals are about winning an instance of a game whereas systems are about &ldquo;continuing to play the game.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should view a habit you want to develop as a lifestyle (since you&rsquo;ll have to do it forever) rather than a finish line to cross.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For habits you wish to get better at, you need a process of reflection and review. Document your efforts and the results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To break a bad habit, you can either decrease your exposure to it or increase the difficulty to access it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In terms of a habit, even if you cannot do the whole thing, you should make a slight improvement. Throw away the &lsquo;all-or-nothing&rsquo; mentality. If you act upon a habit until you feel it can transform your life altogether, you&rsquo;ll end up achieving nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find out the key moments in your day that determine how you spend the next one or two hours. Work backwards from those moments and try to figure out what was the trigger events that caused these moments.</strong></p>

And no one really gets up from the chair and tries to see what is going on with this aircraft. The pilots have passed out and the plane will actually crash because no one takes an interest in the whole structure. They only sit in their seat and breathe into their own masks.

. <em>PNAS, 118</em>(7).</p>
<p>Mean years of schooling (MYS) alone is not sufficient to indicate a person&rsquo;s true skills. The authors proposed a way to measure the quality of human capital. The authors employed the literacy skills dataset for countries across the globe to compute SLAMYS: skills in literacy adjusted mean years of schooling. Figure 3 shows that even though MYS indicates that the gap between the high-performing and low-performing countries is narrowing, the SLAMYS scores show that this gap is increasing fast. According to SLAMYS scores, the gap between countries above 3rd quartile and below 1st quartile is equivalent to ten years of schooling.</p>

<p>During the pandemic, DataCamp saw a 38% increase in the number of new users, and a 6% increase in exercise time by existing users.</p>
<p>Figure 2A shows that a slightly higher proportion of new registration comes from high-income and high-college neighborhoods. Figure 2B shows that people in low-income and low-college communities experience a larger increase in their time spent on DataCamp.</p>
<p>This study indicates that when people have more free time, they can use that time for upskilling, and this change is relatively consistent across regions with varying income, racial and educational compositions. This means that to alleviate the skill gaps in the US workforce, it&rsquo;s a good idea to give employees more free time so that people can upskill.</p>

<p>The authors analyzed posts in r/BreakUps subreddit, and found that a month before, during, and three months after the breakup, people&rsquo;s analytical thinking drops (meaning their thoughts are less structured and logical) whereas cognitive processing increases (meaning that they are trying to understand the situation). Sample markers of cognitive processing (a.k.a, working through) include &ldquo;because&rdquo;, &ldquo;understand&rdquo;, &ldquo;should'', etc. Also evident is that people are using more I-words and We-words.</p>
<p>The authors did not stop here and asked additional two questions: 1. Does writing a lot about the breakup help people recover? 2. How to compare these changes with language changes among people going through other kinds of emotional upheavals?</p>
<p>Most people (84%) spend 1-4 days talking about their breakups, whereas 16% of people spend 5 or more days. Both the short-term and long-term users have similar language patterns (analytical thinking, cognitive processing, I-words, and We-words) during the months leading up to the breakup. However, it takes long-term users twice as much time as short-term users to return to the baseline value of their language patterns. However, it&rsquo;s impossible to establish a causal relationship. It might be that those who spend more time writing about their breakups experience a more difficult time and thus find it hard to adjust.</p>
<p>The changes in language patterns among people who experience divorce in r/Divorce mimic those of r/BreakUps users. But r/offmychest users have somewhat different patterns since they post various kinds of emotional upheavals.</p>

<p>In this Viewpoint, Cal Newport argues that it&rsquo;s better to see the impact of technologies from a determinist viewpoint, that new technologies drive human behaviors into unplanned directions. He takes emails invented by IBM and the &ldquo;Like&rdquo; button by a Facebook engineer as examples. Emails were meant to facilitate internal communication within IBM. However, people began sending much more messages the moment they started emailing. The &ldquo;Like&rdquo; button, designed to replace some approving comments such as &ldquo;nice!&rdquo; and &ldquo;great!&rdquo;, made people check their Facebook account constantly for rewards.</p>
<p>The author later coins the term <em>complex side effects</em>, negative impacts that new technologies may have that are not expected when the technologies were invented. Cal Newport argues that engineers should include the evaluation of complex side effects in their &ldquo;iterative engineering process&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The primary goal of your research is to communicate a &ldquo;useful and re-usable idea&rdquo;. This idea should be &ldquo;clear&rdquo; and &ldquo;sharp&rdquo;.

Distill your paper into one single sentence which conveys the main idea, and make this idea explicit: &ldquo;The main idea of this paper is &mldr;&rdquo;, &ldquo;In this section we present the main contributions of this paper.&rdquo; Many papers have great ideas but they didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;distill what they are&rdquo;.</p>

.</p>
<p>This article is very encouraging and eye-opening for me!</p>
<p>The key idea of this post is that if you are planning to submit a paper to a conference, you need to write your paper right now! It&rsquo;s totally Okay, and even expected, if you haven&rsquo;t run the experiment and don&rsquo;t have any tangible results. You can put empty tables and figures in the Results section. <strong>The main goal of the experiments is to allow you to put numbers in those empty tables/figures</strong>. Remember, you should never postpone writing until your experiment is finished.</p>
<h3 id=why>Why?<a href=#why class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clear writing triumphs over your experimental results in terms of (1) odds of acceptance and (2) likelihood of being cited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you complete the writing before you do the experiment, you can send it to your advisor or colleagues who can give you suggestions. If they think the idea you want to convey sucks, you don&rsquo;t need to waste your time actually doing the experiment. And your writing isn&rsquo;t a waste of time since you may find the idea applicable elsewhere.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id=what-should-you-do>What should you do?<a href=#what-should-you-do class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<p>Write the <em>Introduction</em>, where you need to present a big picture and sell your idea. Then, the <em>lit review</em>. Don&rsquo;t do a lit review before writing your own ideas. This is because after writing your own ideas, you can see them from a different perspective when writing the lit review. Then write the <em>methods</em>/<em>experimental</em> and even the <em>results</em> section. (The author didn&rsquo;t mention the <em>results</em> section. I think it is possible, though.)</p>
<p>Every paper needs a beautiful picture at least. But don&rsquo;t spend time refining it now. Simply put your sketch first.</p>
<p>Remember to document your codes early on. Don&rsquo;t wait until your project is finished. Don&rsquo;t fool yourself.</p>

<p>People in Western individualistic societies value passion and excitement whereas East Asian collectivistic societies value calm and balance. This is why you see so many faces with big toothy smiles in Western societies but less frequently see them in East Asian countries and regions.</p>

<em>PNAS, 118</em>(11).</p>
<p>The study finds that among over 1 million 15-year old students around the globe, passion predicts academic achievement, i.e., scores in science (2015), math (2012), and reading (2009), more strongly in individualistic societies than in collectivistic ones. The result remains the same after controlling for GDP per capita. Other cultural differences than individualism-collectivism are not robust predictors of the relationship between passion and academic achievement. Note that it doesn&rsquo;t mean passion is unimportant in collectivistic societies; Passion is still a significant predictor of academic achievement in these societies.</p>

. <em>PNAS, 118</em>(11).</p>
<p>The authors of this opinion piece argue that partnerships between humanitarian and development organizations (HDOs) such as ICRC, UNICEF, and WHO, and academics may fail.</p>
<ol>
<li>Funding and human resources may be limited.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>HDOs think that universities may have their own funding for experimental studies. However, truly experimental work is not sufficient to produce products that satisfy HDOs' needs as many products are expected to be working in very harsh conditions.</li>
<li>Researchers in universities may see HDOs as an external funding source. However, HDO funds need detailed reporting to donors. Since research needs lots of money and may not produce any tangible results at all, it&rsquo;s very difficult for HDO to spend many financial resources on R&D.</li>
<li>HDO may face a lack of human resources committed to the partnerships. There is lots of paperwork to do and HDO staff already have their tasks. They may not have time to write project plans and funding reports.</li>
</ul>
<ol start=2>
<li>Deployment and sustainability</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Products, for example, medical equipment, need training, maintenance, and upgrade services. However, the company that is tasked with producing the equipment has little interest in these. Training and maintenance needs money which normally comes from selling loads of these products. However, HDO only needs a limited number of them. This won&rsquo;t create profits for the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the partnership produces a publication, researchers are no longer interested in it. They have to move on to other projects that produce papers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start=3>
<li>Roles, responsibilities and expectations</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When HDOs find an interesting publication, they may invest thousands of dollars to implement it. However, there might exist a huge gap between academic publication to implementation. HDOs may waste lots of money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HDOs have a longstanding distrust in commercial sectors and believe academia is neutral. This is wrong. Universities nowadays are very commercialized. HDOs should update their view on companies and universities.</p>

</li>
</ol>
<p>The authors of this opinion argued that a better solution to the replicability crisis in science is to shift the focus from replicating single studies to designing and conducting progressive sequences of studies that accumulate evidence on a certain topic. Researchers should be encouraged to participate in these progressive sequences of studies. Administrations of universities should shift the reward system from emphasizing single studies to these sequences of studies. Funding agencies such as NSF should do the same.</p>

<p>The authors web scripped close to 5,700 visualizations, among which there are 2,070 single visualizations. Then then annotated these visualizations based on their taxonomy for static visualizations (See 3 Visualization Taxonomy). They also tagged the source of each visualization, i.e., infographics, scientific publication, news, and government/world organizations.</p>
<p>They selected a subset of 410 visualizations and presented them to participants on Amazon MTurk. Each visualization <strong>is treated as an image</strong> and is presented for only 1 second. Participants press the key if they see a visualization for the second time. Therefore, this study looks at which types of visualizations as images are more memorable.</p>
<h3 id=results-1>Results<a href=#results-1 class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a visualization is more memorable. It is more memorable for most people. That is to say, &ldquo;[T]he memorability of a visualization is a consistent measure across participants.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following attributes in visualizations contribute to memorability: having pictograms, colorful, chart junk, high visual densities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unique types of visualizations, such as diagrams, networks, and trees are more memorable than common types such as bar, line, and pie charts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infographic visualizations are the most memorable, followed by visualizations from scientific publications, news, and government. Scientific visualizations are memorable possibly because they contain more diagrams.</p>

<p>This work is exciting.</p>
<p>The authors used the same dataset as in <em>What makes a visualization memorable?</em>. 393 single visualizations are selected, among which 100 are randomly chosen to be shown to participants in the <strong>Encoding Phase</strong>. Participants spent 10s on each visualization in this Phase. Then, in <strong>Recognition Phase</strong>participants are shown 200 visualizations (100 are shown before, the other 100 are filler visualizations). The duration of each visualization is 2 seconds. Participants press keys to indicate whether they have seen each visualization in the previous Phase. Lastly, in the <strong>Recall Phase</strong>, each participant is shown the visualizations they managed to recognize in the Recognition Phase. These visualizations are artificially blurred by the authors. Participants are asked to input any information they remember of each visualization in an empty box right next to the visualization.</p>
<p>Here are what the authors find:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a visualization is memorable &ldquo;at a glance&rdquo; (where people see it for only 1 second), it is also more likely to be memorable if people see it for 10 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Human recognizable objects&rdquo; help make visualizations recognizable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visualizations that are the most recognizable after 1 second exposure are likely to get descriptions of the highest quality after 10-second exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A good title helps people recall the visualization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pictograms do not hinder recall.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data and message redundancy help people recognize and recall the visualization.</p>

<p>Overview: The study finds that a redundant encoding (here, value represented with shades of gray) has no benefits nor harm for (1) accuracy and (2) speed of judgement of graphs encoded with single primary encodings (position, angle, area, length).</p>
<h3 id=study-aims>Study aims<a href=#study-aims class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<p>The study examines whether a redundant encoding, in this case, values represented by shades of gray, will boost or harm <strong>accuracy</strong> and <strong>speed</strong> of understanding graphs encoded with various primary encodings (position, length, angle, and area).</p>
<p>The study also examines whether the additive benefit of value, if any, to accurate encodings (e.g., position) will be greater than to less accurate encodings (e.g., area).</p>
<h3 id=results-3>Results<a href=#results-3 class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<ol>
<li>Position is the most accurate encoding, followed by angle, area, and length.</li>
<li>The redundant encodings do not have any effects on the understanding of graphs encoded with the four primary encodings. The hierarchy of accuracy with redundant encodings is the same as that with single primary encodings.</li>
<li>Participants completed tasks on graphs with redundant encodings in the same amount of time as participants completing tasks on graphs with single primary encodings.</li>

<li>Readers might have filtered out the redundant encoding, i.e., values represented with shades of gray, and focused on primary encodings of the graph.</li>

</p>
<p>Key points in this essay:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Duckworth promises in her book more than what &ldquo;grit&rdquo; can deliver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grit is nothing more than other personality traits, such as industriousness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grit matters but only in certain situations in life, not all of them. There is a &ldquo;restriction of range&rdquo;. Some papers concluded that grit does not predict academic success, in New England or in Austria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grit makes some differences in life, but certainly not &ldquo;all the difference in the world&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grit is perhaps just a rebranding, rather than producing something new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It might be impossible to change your personality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Being high in grit might be harmful. For example, you might hurt yourself physically if you are too focused on a goal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some quotes in this essay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And like other self-help authors, she pulls a sleight of hand by which even widely held assumptions end up looking like discoveries. It&rsquo;s as important to work hard, the book contents, as it is to be a natural talent. Who would disagree with that?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For most people, life may be less like a marathon than a series of sprints, interspersed with periods of rest and hours upon hours spent browsing the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s one thing to argue that grit matters more than talent or——more accurately——that your personality helps determine your success. Duckworth goes much further, asserting that you can change your personality and learn to &ldquo;grow your grit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It could be that having too much strength of purpose is worse than having not enough.</p>

<p>Aim: To investigate how other people&rsquo;s expectations of the data influence people&rsquo;s reactions to a visualization: ability to recall, and the trust in, the data.</p>
<p>Hypotheses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>H1: Social information leads to better recall of the data shown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H2: Congruence in social signals leads to higher trust, and higher likelihood of updating their beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H3a: Congruent-HighConsensus leads to higher trust and higher likelihood to update beliefs; Incongruent-HighCnsensus leads to the opposite results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H3b: HighConsensus leads to better recall of the data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>H1 ❌: The presence of social information has no impacts on data recall capability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H2 ✔️: Congruence improves trust, and the likelihood to update beliefs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H3a ❌: The level of Consensus has no impacts on trust and likelihood of belief update in both Congruent and Incongruent groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>H3b ✔️: HighConsensus leads to improved recall.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other findings (which do not seem preregistered):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Social information leads to improved recall when there is high consensus in the social signal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When participants had lower trust in the data even before seeing it, they are more likely to be swayed by the social information they see: lower trust in the data when others disagree with the data, and higher trust when others agree.</p>

<p>This study finds that when participants hold a neutral opinion on a topic or are weakly polarized, charts lead more people to change their views compared to tables (that communicate the same data as in charts). This pattern also exists among positively polarized participants.</p>
<p>A reverse pattern is observed among negatively polarized participants: more people change their opinion when presented with tables. It should be pointed out that this difference is statistically significant for only one of the three topics, although when aggregating the data from all the three topics, the difference is statistically significant.</p>

<p>Lots of publications on misinformation are based on data from social media or websites. However, a nationally representative survey finds that (1) news is a small fraction of media consumption; (2) online news is a small fraction of news consumption; and (3) fake news is only a tiny portion of the information Americans receive.</p>
<p>The authors proposed a comprehensive research agenda that aims to achieve four objectives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To build a large-scale data infrastructure to study the <strong>production</strong> (an updated catalog of relevant information), <strong>consumption and distribution</strong> (to measure people&rsquo;s news consumption continuously across all platforms: social media, desktop, email, instant messaging, etc.), <strong>absorption and understanding</strong> (whether news consumption changes people&rsquo;s beliefs), <strong>action and engagement</strong> (to see whether information people receive translates into action. For example, to protest, to volunteer, or simply to follow/retweet/like/comment on social media).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To build a &ldquo;Mass Collaboration'' Model where people can replicate and accumulate knowledge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To communicate insights obtained from research to nonacademic people. One possible approach is to create data visualizations that constantly update new data.</p>

<p>To build an academic-industry collaboration.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t totally understand the details of this paper but I got the idea. To account for the pattern of meme popularity, meme lifetime, and user activity, The combination of (i) social media structure and (ii) the limited user attention is sufficient. The authors did not prove that the values of memes are not a factor in their popularity. However, they showed that it&rsquo;s possible to predict the pattern of memes on Twitter without considering the intrinsic values of memes.</p>
<p>Fig. 2 shows that a user&rsquo;s &ldquo;breadth of attention&rdquo; is constant despite the growing number of posts/memes in social media.</p>
<p>Fig. 3 shows that people are more likely to retweet something related to what they posted in the past. This means that memory is an important factor in meme competition.</p>

<p>A research paper is &ldquo;a conversation with the past in your field&rdquo;. <strong>&ldquo;with the past&rdquo;</strong> means you need to show the connection of your present paper to the progress made in the past; <strong>&ldquo;in your field&rdquo;</strong> means that you need to show how your work contributes to the development in your specific academic field.</p>
<p>Remember that a research paper is not a lab report, not a technical blog post, not a how-to guide to software, not a news article, not a popular science article for the non-academic folks. To be accepted, your work has to show <strong>its connection to the past</strong> and <strong>its contributions to the development within your chosen specific field</strong>.</p>

<p>To calibrate yourself may take years. Working with your advisor can speed up this process. By observing how your advisor writes the paper, you can absorb the writing norms of your field much faster.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t expect a <em>perfect time</em> to write. It doesn&rsquo;t exist. When you write, first focus on the number of words. That&rsquo;s the easiest thing. Don&rsquo;t worry about the quality in the beginning. Just get the draft done and then you can improve it. If you expect your first few sentences to be perfect, you&rsquo;ll never start writing.</p>
<h3 id=pay-close-attention-to-the-introduction>Pay close attention to the introduction<a href=#pay-close-attention-to-the-introduction class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<p>Always ask yourself, &ldquo;so what?&rdquo; You&rsquo;ve done this study, so what? What problems does it solve? Why should it be published anyway? Who cares?</p>
<p>The introduction should contain <em>the soul of your paper</em>. Keep tweaking it until the submission deadline. Many papers lack a soul because the writers don&rsquo;t spend enough time thinking/writing about the motivation and the value of their work. They submitted anyway. That&rsquo;s too bad.</p>
<h3 id=title-metadata-and-abstract>Title, metadata, and abstract<a href=#title-metadata-and-abstract class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<p>Craft the title and abstract, and choose the right boxes to check (when submitting) in a way that can help your paper to be in the hands of the <em>right</em> people: scholars who have expertise in what you do. They want to see their academic lineage &ldquo;carry on through the papers of newcomers like yourself&rdquo;. By contrast, those outside of your specific (sub)field do not appreciate your work and don&rsquo;t have incentives to have it published.</p>
<h3 id=quantity-and-quality>Quantity and quality<a href=#quantity-and-quality class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<p>Quantity and quality aren&rsquo;t that different. Those who publish good work are also those who publish a lot of work. Therefore, don&rsquo;t procrastinate. Come up with ideas, do research, write, submit, revise, and publish. Just write! Writing will never be easy. You have to go through those <em>miseries</em> to get things done.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t submit papers you know aren&rsquo;t good enough. Don&rsquo;t waste reviewers' time. However, keep in mind that even the best work can be rejected. There is much randomness involved.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t let your top choice be your first interview, as you&rsquo;ll most likely screw up the first one.</p>

<li>
<p>Never schedule more than one interview per week. You need time to relax.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>For your job talk, practice, practice, practice. You need to practice a lot! You can practice in front of your colleagues and friends, who can then give you suggestions for improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For one-on-one interviews, prepare a document of <em>talking points</em>. See Section 4.2 for more details. Whenever a professor asks you questions not in this document, add this question to it.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id=4-interviewing>4. Interviewing<a href=#4-interviewing class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pay attention to and be aware of why they brought you there in the first place. Is it because your research fits into the department&rsquo;s future agenda? Play up these parts in your talk and individual meetings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to <em>Engage</em>, not to <em>impress</em>. Professors interviewing you have much more research experience and publications than you do. There is no need to impress others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id=41-job-talk>4.1 Job talk<a href=#41-job-talk class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you cannot <em>hook</em> the audience in the first 10 minutes, chances are your talk will just be mediocre.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NEVER</strong> say anything impromptu, i.e., only say what you have practiced! And <strong>NEVER</strong> exceed the time limit. Professors are busy and no one wants to spend more time than necessary on your talk. You should be mindful of the time limit of your talk even when you are answering questions from the audience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What your job talk is supposed to show:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Solid past research&rdquo;. Start with the overarching motivation before diving into two specific projects you are most proud of.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Compelling future research&rdquo;. Dedicate the final 10 minutes to this part. Be bold.</li>
<li>Capability + Personality. Through your talk, the audience should know that you are the person who will be successful academically and you will be a chill colleague.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>You can take notes while talking, but only write down key words that help you write follow-up emails later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What you can write about in your follow up emails: Thanking them for being interested in your research; for giving you suggestions for your research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remeber to let <strong>the other person</strong> lead the meeting. Be comfortable with short sliences. It&rsquo;s better to let them control the meeting. Be a good listener.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During conversations with faculty, try to make <strong>connections</strong> with them. When they lead the talk and talk about their research, you can mention how their studies relate to yours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why are CONNECTIONS super important? Because if there are no connections at all, they won&rsquo;t even remember you and won&rsquo;t have anything to say about you after the meeting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try HARD to appeal to your &ldquo;talk mates&rdquo;, even if they are in totally different subfields than yours. Everyone&rsquo;s vote accounts in hiring decisions. You cannot afford losing anyone&rsquo;s vote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be open, sincere, and honest. If they ask you where you are also applying besides their institution, let them know openly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no need to spend TOO MUCH time getting to know every one of your &ldquo;talk mates&rdquo; beforehand. They know you are busy and don&rsquo;t expect that you know about their research in detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People sign up for meetings with you for a reason. For example, they may want to collaborate with you; they want to know whether your research strengthens the department research portfolio; or that they are on the faculty search committee. Only when you let the other party lead the meeting, and be a good listener, can you know what they want from you and then adapt accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow-up emails to people you talk to are VERY important.</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you become a first-year assistant professor, you&rsquo;ll have a lot of free time. You only need to dedicate roughly six hours per week (3 hours to teaching, and 3 hours to department and committee meetings). You are free to do whatever you want for the rest of your time each week. <strong>This freedom is the challenge</strong>: you have to learn how to manage this free time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tenure. From the first day of your job, you have about five years to build up your publication list, submit your material in the sixth year, and hopefully get tenure. To get tenure, you need (1) to get recommendation letters from full professors detailing why you are the best in the field you are in; and (2) to have good relationships with tenured colleagues in your department so that they will interpret the recommendation letters in the most favorable light. For the first requirement, if your research is super innovative, then you risk not being able to find enough recommenders in your &ldquo;field&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even though tenure is a big thing, you shouldn&rsquo;t wishfully think that things will be better after you get tenure. Also, don&rsquo;t do something you don&rsquo;t enjoy simply to get tenure with the hope that you can do what you really love after tenure. Rather, be true to yourself, do what you love <em>right now</em>, and have a lifestyle you desire <em>right now</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Back to time management, the key is to <strong>prioritize</strong>. Even though your life as a professor seems free, you have tons of things to do. Your time and energy is limited, so you have to prioritize the most important things and give up other no-so-important things. Otherwise, you won&rsquo;t have focused attention and energy to do your job well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No need to be stressed out by tenure. It&rsquo;s easier to get tenure than to get fired as faculty.</p>

<p>This paper is very different from many papers I read, possibly because the author is an employee of the government. It aims to provide information for researchers interested in one topic, rather than to show a scientific result obtained through the author&rsquo;s research. It&rsquo;s an eye-opener for me, since it lets me know a different way of writing a paper. But I guess this format is very rare in the scientific community. It&rsquo;s more like a lab report.</p>

<h3 id=study-1>Study 1<a href=#study-1 class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Purpose: To see whether mistaken belief is sufficient to explain the sharing of misinformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedure: 1015 participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants are presented with headlines, lead sentences, and images for 36 news stories obtained from social media. Half of these stories were entirely false and the other half are true. Half of the headlines are favorable to Democrats and the other half favorable to Republicans. Participants were randomly assigned to decide either the veracity of the headline they saw (accuracy condition) or their intention to share the story (sharing condition).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the accuracy condition, true headlines are rated as accurate significantly more often than false headlines. Whereas politically concordant headlines are rated as accurate more than politically discordant headlines, this difference stemming from political alignment is significantly smaller than the veracity-driven difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the sharing condition, the difference in sharing intention based on political alignment is significantly larger than the veracity-driven difference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Across conditions: the effect of headline veracity is significantly larger in the accuracy condition than in the sharing condition; the effect of political alignment is significantly larger in the sharing condition than in the accuracy condition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a disconnect between accuracy rating and sharing intention: even though very few Republicans rated a headline as accurate in the accuracy condition, many Republicans in the sharing condition intend to share it. This disconnection disputes the confusion theory (which states that people share misinformation because they do not know the information is false): People can detect the falsehood, but decide to share it nonetheless.</p>
<p>People do care about veracity when deciding whether to share or not, according to a study (Coppock & McClellan, 2019). Then, why do people knowingly share misinformation? The authors of the current study formulate the idea that the context of social media primed people to please followers or signal their membership.</p>
<h3 id=study-3--study-4>Study 3 & Study 4<a href=#study-3--study-4 class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<p>Control condition: participants are shown 24 news headlines (half true & half false; half favorable to Democrats & half favorable to Republicans) and asked how likely they are to share each headline on Facebook.</p>
<p>Treatment condition: participants are asked to rate the accuracy of <strong>one single non-partisan</strong> news headline at the start of the experiment and then go on to go through the same procedure as in the control condition.</p>
<p>As shown in Figure 2, participants in the treatment condition are significantly less likely to consider sharing false news headlines than those in the control condition. This treatment effect is significantly larger for politically concordant headlines than for politically discordant news. However, participants in the two conditions are equally likely to consider sharing true headlines.</p>
<p>In Study 3, the difference in sharing intention for veracious versus fake headlines is 2.0 times bigger in the treatment condition relative to the control condition. This figure is 2.4 in Study 4.</p>
<p>In both studies, participants in both conditions when asked after the experiment do not differ significantly in how important it is to share only veracity.</p>
<h3 id=study-5>Study 5<a href=#study-5 class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<p>A more representative group of participants are recruited through Lucid.</p>
<p>Besides the two conditions in Study 3 & 4, there are also an active condition (in which participants are asked to rate the humorousness rather than the veracity of a single news headline before the experiment) and an importance treatment condition (in which participants before the experiment are asked about the importance they attached to only sharing true content). The results replicated those in Study 3 and 4. See Fig. 2-c.</p>
<p>As Fig. 3 a-c shows, there exists a positive correlation between the perceived accuracy (rated categorically as 1-7, with 7 indicating the most accurate) and the treatment effect in Study 3, 4, & 5. For each headline, the treatment effect is measured as the <code>$Sharing intention_{treatment condition} - Sharing intention_{control condition}$</code>.</p>
<p>This positive correlation means that the least accurate news headlines are the ones that the &ldquo;accuracy salience treatment&rdquo; discouraged people from sharing the most.</p>
<p>Study 7: I do not understand it. It seems that this part is written by a different person. But I know the conclusion of Study 7: the accuracy message led Twitter users who frequently share misinformation to increase the quality of the content they share.</p>
<p>Overall, this article supports the idea that shifting people&rsquo;s attention to accuracy discourages them from sharing misinformation.</p>

<p>I agree. The most important thing about writing is getting the first draft down, even with tears on your face. Don&rsquo;t procrastinate. Don&rsquo;t expect the first draft to be elegant. You just need to get enough words, which will make you less anxious (as you now have a draft, as shitty as it is). Then you can spend more time later editing it.</p>

<p>The trick here is that you need to separate <em>generating</em> text from <em>editing</em>. These two activities involve different activities.</p>
<p>When generating texts, don&rsquo;t look at the words you&rsquo;ve produced, and don&rsquo;t think about the quality. Just write down what&rsquo;s in your mind. <em>Editing</em> is another job you&rsquo;ll do later, not now.</p>
<p>After generating enough texts, then you can edit them.</p>

<p>As an author, you should shoulder the responsibility of <strong>convincing the reader of the contribution of your work</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some reviewers may conclude that your paper should be rejected before they read all of your content. Therefore, their criticism will only be for the first few pages. It is wrong to conclude that they are satisfied with the remaining part of your paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If reviewers comment that your work lacks a thorough literature review, you should not assume that adding some references will solve the problem. This kind of criticism implies that they don&rsquo;t think your work is important in the context of extant research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reviewers might send confidential comments to editors and associated editors, which are invisible to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your paper is rejected by a journal and you decide to submit it to another journal after revision, you should send a note to the editor explaining the history of your work. Do not simply do &ldquo;journal shopping&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be objective, emotionally detached, and friendly in your response to reviewers' comments. No matter how offended you feel, do not insult reviewers' competence or their motives. Be &ldquo;gracious, humble, and constructive&rdquo;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If reviewers do not appear to understand your paper, take the responsibility, explain, clarify, and educate, rather than attacking reviewers' competence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if you feel a criticism is unjustified, and no revision for it is necessary, it&rsquo;s better to make relevant changes according to the criticism and describe your improvements. You can make your points clearer if you feel they are correct, rather than arguing no revision is needed, which sounds arrogant to the reviewers.</p>

<p>Outcome uncertainty is more useful for individuals than inferential uncertainty. The former is predicting what an individual outcome is likely to be, whereas the latter one shows the group average. It&rsquo;s possible that the group with a larger mean has more variability, whereas the other group (with a smaller mean) is more reliable. Wise people will choose the second one rather than the first one.</p>

<li>
<p>People tend to overestimate the effect size and understated the variability in outcomes when presented 95% confidence intervals that show <em>inferential</em> uncertainty, compared to when presented 95% prediction intervals that show <em>outcome</em> uncertainty.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we are comparing heights of men with those of women:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Inferential</em> uncertainty is how confident we are about our estimation of <strong>each group&rsquo;s average height</strong>, based on <strong>our measurement</strong>. So error bars will extend 1.96 (sometimes 1.0) <em>standard error</em> above and below the mean.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Outcome</em> uncertainty is the variability of <strong>each individual&rsquo;s height around their group&rsquo;s mean</strong>. Therefore, error bars will extend 1.96 (sometimes 1.0) <em>standard deviation</em> above and below the mean.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See Fig. 1 for illustration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People have the largest misperceptions when the effect size is small. Unfortunately, small effect sizes are the norm in scientific studies, which use 95% CI more often than 95% PI. This indicates that readers are likely to exaggerate the scientific results they encounter.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence is powered by deep learning, which are algorithms that use statistics to identify patterns in data. This capability enables computers to mimic human skills, and to provide recommendations to users (for example, in Google, Facebook, and Netflix).</p>
<p>Papers in arXiv&rsquo;s artificial intelligence section focused on machine learning in around 1995-2005, on neural networks in around 2010-2015, and on reinforcement learning in around 2015-2019.</p>
<p>Before around 2005, papers in arXiv&rsquo;s AI section focused on &ldquo;knowledge-based reasoning&rdquo;, trying to recreate human seasoning using man-made rules. After around 2005, the attention changed to machine learning, which is a parent term that includes deep learning. Rather than writing rules, machine learning trains computer programs to extract rules from a sea of data.</p>
<p>Besides neural networks, there are other machine learning methods, for example, &ldquo;bayesian networks”, &ldquo;markov methods”, and &ldquo;support vector machines&rdquo;, but neural networks have dominated the playground since around 2016.</p>
<p>Three types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning wasn&rsquo;t a new idea, but it didn&rsquo;t gain much momentum until AlphaGo&rsquo;s groundbreaking success.</p>

<p>People overestimated both error and variance of effect size when only told the mean differences. 95% confidence intervals with visualizations led to the largest overestimation, as shown in Figure 2. Presending the mean differences in absolute or percentage terms, or simply telling people difference exists, made people overestimate the effect size as well, but to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>Informing people the variability helped alleviate this issue, with directly telling people the probability of superiority performing the best (although the difference did not reach statistical significance).</p>

<p>As Fig. 1(B) shows, the percentage of publications in both <em>Nature</em> and <em>Physical Review D</em> by new PIs have been decreasing in the past two decades. The figure also shows that different types of journals have different patterns regarding the share of papers by different categories of PIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chaperone effect <code>$C$</code> is measured as</p>
<p><code>$$ c / c_{random} $$</code></p>
<p>where <code>$c$</code> is the ratio of <strong>the number of authors who became last authors from non-last authors</strong> to <strong>the number of those who never made this transition</strong>. <code>$c_random$</code> is the same ratio but in a system where the order of authors is randomly permuted. This randomization is necessary if we want to compare the chaperone effect of different scientific fields. If we measure the chaperone effect by <code>$c$</code> rather than <code>$C$</code>, we fail to consider the fact that <code>$c$</code> might be influenced by individual productivity, team size, or simply random factors.</p>
<p>If <code>$C$</code> is larger one 1, then the chaperone effect exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fig. 2 shows that the chaperone effect is strongest in interdisciplinary fields, biology, and medicine, and weakest in Mathematics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An interesting question to ask is whose papers have more impact, those by new PIs, or those by chaperoned and established PIs. The authors assumed that those by new PIs have more impact because it is difficult to publish in a journal, say, in <em>Nature</em>, if you didn&rsquo;t have a publication record there. However, results show that papers by established and chaperoned PIs receive more citations.</p>

<p>This paper investigates why there is a gender pay gap among STEM graduates. They hypothesized that engineering self-efficacy (ESE) is the reason. To test this hypothesis, they surveyed 559 college students majoring in engineering and computer science in 2015 (when students are still enrolled in the program), 2016, and later in 2017 when students just graduated and entered the workforce.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic is projected to cause a decline in 2021 US life expectancy by 1.13 y. This decline is larger than that in other developed countries, which already had higher life expectancy than the US before the pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reduction in life expectancy in the US is not the same for each racial group. The reduction for Black (2.10 y) and Latino (3.05 y) is much larger than that for Whites (0.68 y).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Black and Latino populations, younger people face a higher burden of mortality related to the COVID-19. This might be because their jobs are less compatible with remote working and therefore they have to expose themselves to viruses to earn money during the pandemic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These racial differences in reduction in life expectancy will result in 39% increase in the life expectancy gap between the Black population and Whites (from 3.6 y in 2017 to 5.06 y in 2020). The life expectancy advantage that Latino population has relative to Whites will decrease from 3.3 y in 2017 to 0.93 y in 2020, a 70% plunge.</p>

<p>This study tries to answer <strong>why some people are more likely than others to experience the presence of gods and spirits</strong>. In four studies, the authors, possibly among others, interviewed and surveyed local residents having faith (in charismatic evangelical Christianity or the local religion) and urban undergraduate students in four places: US, Ghana, Thailand and China.</p>
<p>The study found that <strong>porosity</strong> and <strong>absorption</strong> played distinct roles in people&rsquo;s spiritual experiences across different cultures and religions.</p>
<p><strong>Porosity</strong> is a cultural attribution that defines the boundary between &ldquo;mind&rdquo; and the &ldquo;world&rdquo;. People living in cultures of different levels of porosity might have different viewpoints on whether their mental experiences come from and have influences on the outside world.</p>
<p><strong>Absorption</strong> is a personal tendency to be immersed in their own minds.</p>

<p>The authors proposed a model: &ldquo;container model&rdquo;. This model, if given the trajectories of an individual, can infer the hierarchical levels of the mobility traces, and the size of each level. Based on the mobility traces of more than 700K people, the authors found that the mobility of these people has four hierarchical levels. This means that day-to-day human mobility is not scale-free. However, when we aggregate displacements across containers (I do not fully understand what this means, though), human mobility is scale-free.</p>
<p>Fig. 2 shows that container models do a much better job than other models in predicting mobility traces.</p>

<p>What is the share of open access journal articles</p>
<p>Around 27.9% of all articles with a DOI. Recent articles are more likely to be open access (See <a href=https://peerj.com/articles/4375/#fig-2 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">Fig. 2B</a>

<p>Open access articles received 18% more citations than if it were not open access. This is only correlation, not causation. It might well be that authors only made their most impactful work open access.</p>

</ol>
<p>The authors got access to detailed cell records data of 1.5 million subscribers in Rwanda. They did a phone survey involving 856 individuals, who were among the 1.5 million subscribers. The authors built a model that can predict an individual&rsquo;s wealth based on these 856 individuals' answers and their cell records. The authors used this model to predict the wealth of Rwanda by district and found that it very well matched the actual wealth index as computed from a national survey of over 10k households in Rwanda.</p>
<p>The authors argued that administering a national survey is very slow and costly. Predicting wealth from cell phone data is fast and relatively cheap. This method is accessible because a considerable number of people in developing countries are using cell phones now.</p>

<p>Does exposure to social media increase or decrease belief polarization? This study tries to answer this question via a field experiment lasting for one and a half months on Twitter. The authors hired a company to recruit Twitter users who identify themselves as Republicans and Democrats. 1652 people participated in the study (901 Democrats and 751 Republicans).</p>
<p>Later, participants were invited to follow a Twitter bot that would retweet 24 messages/day for a month. The bot was designed to retweet counterattitudinal messages to the participants, i.e., Democrats would be assigned to a conservative bot and Republicans to a liberal bot. Participants did not know what types of bots they were going to be assigned to. Among those invited to follow a bot, 64.9% of Democrats and 57.2% of Republicans accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>14,341 participants were recruited from a teen-interest website. They were randomly assigned to two conditions (independent vs. social influence) and rated 48 songs by different bands.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the independent condition, participants were only shown the name of the bands and the songs. After listening to a song, they were asked to rate it; the rating ranged from 1 to 5. After rating, they were given the choice to download the song, although they were not required to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the social influence condition, participants also saw how many times a song has been downloaded by previous participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There were eight &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; to which participants in the social influence condition were assigned to. Each world is parallel to each other, meaning that the number of downloads in one world does not affect other worlds.</p>

<p>The authors of this paper conducted two experiments.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In experiment 1, 48 songs were presented in a <code>$16 \times 3$</code> grid where the order of the songs was random. In experiment 1, participants in the social condition saw the number of downloads along with the name of the band whereas participants in the independent condition did not see this information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In experiment 2, songs were presented in a single column. For participants in the social condition in experiment 2, the songs were shown in descending order of current downloaded counts, whereas the order was random for participants in the independent condition in experiment 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did the authors conduct two experiments? Through this design, in each experiment, the authors can see the effects of social influence on the success of each song. Furthermore, they can see the effect of increased &ldquo;strength&rdquo; of related information signals (i.e., downloaded numbers) by comparing the results of two experiments (for the social influence condition).</p>

<li>Is it possible that the above mentioned epidemiological patterns were due to increasing testing capacity rather than travel restrictions?</li>
</ul>
<p>The authors of the paper introduced a binary variable of testing capacity, whose value was &ldquo;low&rdquo; before 2020-01-20, the date when COVID-19 was categorized as a class B notifiable disease, and &ldquo;high&rdquo; after 2020-01-20. Compared to the naive model (see the end of p.1 of the paper for detail regarding this model), inclusion of human mobility data from Wuhan alone led to improvements in the model&rsquo;s prediction for 12 provinces (among 27 provinces that reported cases through 2020-02-06). In 10 other provinces, both testing capacity and human mobility from Wuhan improved prediction. Only for Hunan did testing alone contributed the most to the model&rsquo;s prediction. Therefore, the authors concluded that although testing capacity is important, in the early stage of the epidemic, Wuhan lockdown was the most important &ldquo;driver of spread&rdquo; (p. 3).</p>

<p>The volume and frequency of human movement from Wuhan to other places in China predicted the size of the early epidemic in other provinces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After 2020-02-01, daily case counts became less correlated with human movement from Wuhan. This indicates that variability among different places in daily case counts was more likely due to factors other than human mobility from Wuhan before the Wuhan lockdown. This also indicates that travel restrictions are important in the early phase of epidemic control, but later, the importance of other local mitigation methods increased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From 2020-01-09 to 2020-01-22, variation in the epidemic&rsquo;s growth rate in provinces outside of Hubei was almost entirely explained by human mobility from Wuhan. After drastic control measures were taken across China, growth rates became negatively correlated with human movement from Wuhan; that is to say, provinces with more human mobility from Wuhan before the lockdown saw smaller growth rates.</p>

<p>The <em>Q</em>-model corrected the two shortcomings of the <em>R</em>-model.</p>
<p>According to the Q-model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A paper&rsquo;s potential impact <code>$p_\alpha$</code> is independent of a scientist&rsquo;s productivity <code>$N_i$</code> and parameter <code>$Q_i$</code>, which means that there is luck behind the impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>High <em>Q</em> is only slightly correlated with higher <em>N</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the question is, what the hidden parameter of <em>Q</em> is, and what it indicates? According to the authors, <em>Q</em> is a constant ability to turn a project with randomly picked impact into high-impact. For each scientist, this ability is <strong>a constant</strong> (for 76% of all scientists); it does not grow with the development of the career stage.</p>

<p>Continued with Sinatra et al. (2016)</p>
<p>So, what is the role of a scientist&rsquo;s ability in impact generation?</p>
<p>The authors first created a <strong>Random-impact model (R-model)</strong>. This model assumes that no matter for whom, the impact of each scientific paper is randomly chosen from the same impact distribution <code>$P(c_{10})$</code>. Then, the only difference scientists is <strong>productivity <code>$N$</code></strong>: how many papers she gets published in her career. This model accurately predicts the cumulative function of <code>$P(\ge N^*/N)$</code> (Fig. 2E). However, this model has two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If each paper&rsquo;s impact is randomly selected from a universal distribution of <code>$P(c_{10})$</code>, then a scientist with a higher <code>$N$</code> will be more likely to have a higher <code>$c^*_{10}$</code>, i.e., the citation of the highest impact paper. However, the R-model fails to predict this. See Fig. 3C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scientists with a higher average impact without <code>$c^*_{10}$</code> will also score higher on <code>$c^*_{10}$</code>. That is to say, high impact papers are more likely to be produced by a scientist with a constantly high impact. Again, the R-model fails to predict this. See Fig. 3D.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The authors then proposed an alternative model, <strong>Q-model</strong>. This model assumes that (1) as in the R-model, each paper&rsquo;s impact is randomly selected from a universal distribution of <code>$P(c_{10})$</code>, and (2) each scientist <code>$i$</code> has a unique value <code>$Q_i$</code> that modulates impact. <code>$Q_i$</code> is a constant throughout a scientist&rsquo;s career. The impact of a paper published by a scientist <code>$i$</code> is the product of <code>$Q_i$</code>, and <code>$p_\alpha$</code> randomly drawn from the distribution <code>$P(p)$</code> which is the same for all scientists .</p>

<p>Fig. 2E: The random impact rule is further confirmed by Fig. 2E. This figure captures the cumulative distribution of <code>$P(\ge N^*/N)$</code>, where <code>$N^*/N$</code> denotes when the highest-impact paper of a scientist occurs. The fact that it is a straight line indicates that the highest-impact factor can appear anytime within a scientist&rsquo;s career.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fig. 2A: We can clearly see the differences in impacts across three levels impact scientists. What&rsquo;s the reason behind it: increasing productivity or increasing creativity? The authors again randomized the papers' impact while keeping scientists' productivity unchanged. The results for both high- and low- impact scientists remained unchanged. Therefore, differences in scientists can be better explained by productivity (see Fig. 1E)</p>

<ul>
<li>A first look at Fig. 2D might tell us that the chance to publish the highest-impact paper drops with age. However, when the impact of papers was randomized, while keeping a scientist&rsquo;s productivity each year unchanged, the distribution of the timing of <code>$t^*$</code> remains almost the same. This is a very important finding, as it means that a scientist can produce her highest impact paper <strong>anytime</strong> in her career.</li>
</ul>
<p>P.3</p>
<p><div class=note>
I am not sure whether it&rsquo;s only the order of a scientist&rsquo;s papers that was randomized or that the order remains unchanged but papers' <code>$c_{10}$</code> were randomized. The authors did not make this point crystal clear.

<p>For a scientist, the timing of the highest-impact paper is truly uniform within the career, meaning that he or she can do ground-breaking work anytime within his or her academic career.</p>

<p>Major findings: 1) Even though more journal articles published long ago became available online, scientists tend to cite more recent papers; 2) Even though more articles are becoming online, fewer journals and articles are being cited, and citations become concentrated on fewer journals and articles.</p>
<p>Evans (2008) explains that this might be because scholars find it easier to locate prevailing opinions if they search online. Journals and articles that scholars might skim in the print age now are overlooked, pushing the citation to newer and fewer articles. This is alarming because it indicates that as online journals become more available, scientific studies are building upon fewer, rather than more, ideas.</p>

<p>The title of this paper explains the main finding. One point worth noticing is that, as the authors mentioned at the end of the paper, fundings from the government for individuals or small teams do not enable smaller teams to produce disruptive results. This is because small teams funded by the government don&rsquo;t want to take the risk of entering uncharted areas.</p>
<p>This paper explains my intuition: more and more scientists, and more and more money invested in research, do not necessarily mean more ground-breaking results. Also, I don&rsquo;t believe large teams should always dominate the science community. I also don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea to always promote publications with a massive number of individuals. Teamwork is great, but does not always produce disruptive work.</p>

<p>Key question: technologies give people more choices regarding consuming news. How does this affect the overall news consumption pattern? Do audiences become more fragmented (i.e., &ldquo;audiences disperse among the higher number of choices&rdquo;)?</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Selective exposure exists but it does not grow in magnitude amongst increasing choices of news content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pattern and effect of consuming news on desktop are different than that of consuming news on multiplatform, with the later reaching increasingly larger audiences, attracting more time spent on news consumption, and making audiences less fragmented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than half of the US population access little to no news. These people might also be susceptible to misinformation.</p>

<p>Study design:</p>
<p>Data about family and children were available only for waves 1-5 (from child birth to age 9) but not available yet for wave 6 (child age 15). Researchers tried to predict the results (child GPA, child grit, household eviction, household material hardship, caregiver layoff, and caregiver participation in job training) of wave 6 based on the whole data for waves 1-5 and half of the data for wave 6.</p>
<p>Result:</p>
<p>Scientists leveraging complicated machine learning algorithms could not predict those outcomes correctly. If a score of 1 means perfectly accurate, and 0 not accurate at all, the best predictions got a score of 0.2 for material hardship and child GPA, and only 0.05 for the other four outcomes. Also note that a linear regression or logistic regression model with only four variables chosen by domain experts were only slightly worse than the best submission, and were much better than most of the other submissions.</p>

<p>Four groups:</p>

<p>Group 2, 3, and 4 are all structured social networks with an equal number of conservatives and liberals. Group 2 were only shown the average of their 4 network neighbors, without any other information exhibited. Group 3 were shown the average of their neighbors plus the logos of political parties. Group 4 were shown the average as well, along with the neighbors political identity.</p>
<p>Each group provided estimates for three times. For the first round, each member estimated independently.</p>
<p>In Round 2 and Round 3, the control group revised their answers independently. Group 2 revised their answers while being exposed to their neighbors' average answer. Group 3 revised their answer while being exposed to Republican and Democratic party logos below their neighbors' average estimate. Group 4 revised their response while being shown the usernames, political identification, and the average of each of their four neighbors, and the average of these four neighbors' answers.</p>
<h3 id=results-8>Results<a href=#results-8 class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<p>Group 2: both liberals and conservatives improved their trend accuracy, with an elimination of partisan bias in interpreting climate change data. Even conservatives in this group predicted trends significant more accurately than liberals in the control condition.</p>
<p>Group 3: there was no effect of social learning, and belief polarization in Round 1 was maintained.</p>
<p>Group 4: trend accuracy improved but moderate belief polarization remained.</p>
<p>(Belief polarization means that liberals significantly outperformed conservatives in predicting climate change trends.)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Exposure to logos of political parties had a stronger effect on decreasing the impact of social learning than exposure to neighbors' political identity.</p>

<p>Can social learning reduce polarization in homogeneous networks (i.e., networks that are not bipartisan)? Robustness tests showed that <strong>the effect of social learning was reduced in politically homogeneous networks</strong>: by Round 3, trend accuracy of conservatives in these echo chambers did not differ significantly from conservatives in the control condition.</p>
<p><div class=reminder>
Considering this result, instead of saying the effect of social learning was <strong>reduced</strong>, I think it&rsquo;s more accurate to say it was <strong>removed</strong>.
</div></p>
<p>Another question is whether the effect of social learning remains if participants in Group 4 were shown individual answers rather than an average. Results showed that the effect of social learning was robust to exposure to individual responses.</p>
<p><div class=reminder>
I am very puzzled by the result. It showed that the effect of social learning was eliminated in homogeneous networks, but the paper of <em>the wisdom of partisan crowds</em> showed exactly <a href=/en/apad/#2020-11-16-edited-on-2020-11-19-and-2020-11-20>the opposite result</a>

</ol>
<p><strong>Aim</strong>: to see whether there is &ldquo;wisdom of crowds&rdquo; in politically homogeneous networks.</p>
<p><strong>Experiment design</strong>:</p>
<p>Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: control condition vs social condition. They were asked to provide an answer to a question for three times (rounds):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Participants in the control condition provided the answer independently for three times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those in the social condition answered independently in Round 1. In Round 2, they were shown the average answer of four other participants connected to them in a social network and then updated their answer. In Round 3, they were shown the average of the updated answers of four other participants connected to them (same in Round 2) and provided a final answer to the question.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A network consists of 35 participants who share the same political orientation (either Democrats or Republicans). Participants in the network <strong>did not</strong> know that other people in the network had the same partisan preference as theirs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The researchers tested four questions. Each question was answered by 3 network groups and 1 control group for each political party.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Results of Experiment 1: Information exchange in homogeneous networks increased accuracy for both party members and decreased belief polarization.</p>
<p>Individual learning (being able to edit their answers in Round 2 and 3) was not the reason for increased accuracy because <strong>the decrease in truth-centered mean (absolute distance from the mean) in the social group was significantly larger than that in the control group</strong>. Therefore, the change should be attributed to information from others.</p>
<p>Another possible reason is that the increased accuracy for groups as a whole obscured the decreased accuracy at an individual level, for example, when the standard deviation of truth-centered mean in a group increased. Results showed that for social groups, the standard deviation of responses in Round 3 was significantly smaller than that in Round 1. This change did not occur in the control group, indicating that <strong>similarity within social groups increased</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Replication study design</strong> has some differences from Experiment 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>More controversial questions;</li>
<li>Participants were required to confirm their political preference before participating in the study;</li>
<li>The experiment interface included an image of an elephant and a donkey;</li>
<li>The answer from four other connected participants were accompanied by their political orientation;</li>
<li>Subjects knew that they were participating in a study related to &ldquo;Politics Challenge&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>Items 2 - 5 were partisan primes intended to &ldquo;enhance the effects of partisan bias on social information processing&rdquo; (p. 4).</p>
<p>Results of the replication study: same as in Experiment 1, social learning increased participants' answer accuracy for both Democrats and Republicans. Participants within each group became more similar over time.</p>
<p>So,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&mldr; social learning is robust to partisan priming for both group-level improvement and individual improvement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how about the difference between Democrats and Republicans? The above results showed &ldquo;within group&rdquo; changes but not between group changes. Results showed that between-group similarity also increased for participants in the social condition (37% for Experiment 1 and 46% for the replication study), which means that polarization decreased.</p>
<p><strong>To recap</strong>: social information exchange within homogeneous networks helped people make more accurate estimates. Similarity within and between groups increased, indicating that people within social groups got similar, and that polarization diminished. And this result withstood partisan priming.</p>
<p>My question: Will the result stay the same if information exchange is not confined to numeric estimates? Why don&rsquo;t we allow people to chat? Is it because of lack of technical support or that there is theoretical consideration against it?</p>
<p>Conclusion: Homogeneous networks do not necessarily lead to polarization. In fact, polarization is decreased and accuracy increased.</p>
<p>Then why do we still have polarized public opinions? This is because popular social media are centralized networks, which make influencers able to exert disproportionate effects on other people in the network.</p>
<p>Future directions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any other reasons why &ldquo;echo chambers&rdquo; and polarization coexist in reality?</li>
<li>Is it possible to replicate this study in real-life networks? For example, in Facebook or Twitter, where information exchange is not limited to numeric estimates?</li>
<li>How could we eliminate, or at least reduce the effects of influencers in a network, if ever possible?</li>

<p>Even without digital tools to communicate with each other, rebel activities became more widespread in Syria. This is surprising because without telecommunication, Syrian rebels lost long ties that bridge groups far away from each other. That is, they had to rely on face-to-face communication to coordinate. How did it happen? When you get to understand that the way behaviors spread is different from that information diffuses, the answer will become clearer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information, messages, and ideas spread like an epidemic whereas human behaviors don&rsquo;t. Contagions can be classified into two types: simple and complex. A single contact can start a simple contagion, but won&rsquo;t do the same for complex contagions, which involve efforts and costs, and require confirmation or reinforcement from multiple sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long ties are enough for simple contagions whereas complex contagions favor wide ties. How wide should a tie be for a behavior to spread varies. If reputation is at stake, the threshold will be higher. That&rsquo;s where complex contagions are very different from simple ones. In simple contagions, hubs get infected early and then it spreads the infections to many others. In a complex contagion, however, hubs usually have reputation at stake, so they are less, rather than more, likely to get infected.</p>

<p>An interesting finding in this study is that after interacting with each other in social networks (which was limited to numeric estimates in the study), smokers and nonsmokers did not differ significantly in their perceptions of smokers' ability to understand health information associated with smoking.

<p>Control group: 40 smokers / 40 non-smokers, so 80 people in each trail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anonymous network group: 40 people (20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers) were embedded into a random social network that is decentralized and anonymous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informative network group: 40 people (20 smokers and 20 nonsmokers) were put into a social network where they could see the usernames and the smoking status of their four network neighbors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Procedure:</p>
<p>Participants were shown an <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0227813.g002" target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-smoking advertisement</a>
and were asked to estimate the health risk of smoking by answering this question: How many people (in millions) are predicted to die from tobacco use in developed countries, in 2030?</p>
<p>Participants were incentivized by monetary reward awarded based on the accuracy of their final answer. Changes in answers' accuracy were measured by the difference between Round 1 and Round 3.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Round 1: Participants in all groups provided the answer independently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Round 2: Group 1 revised their estimates with independent reflection. Group 2 were shown the average response of their contacts and then revised their estimates. Group 3 were also shown the average response by their four contacts. They were also shown the usernames and the smoking status of their contacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Round 3: Same as in Round 2.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Results:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Round 1, both smokers and nonsmokers were equally inaccurate at estimating the health risk of smoking;</li>
<li>No significant improvement in estimated accuracy in the control group.</li>
<li>The decrease in estimate error in group 2 was significantly greater than both smoker and nonsmokers in the control group;</li>
<li>The decrease in estimated error in group 3 was significantly greater than group 2. Specifically, this decrease is ten times greater than both smoker and nonsmoker in the control group.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The more equity in people&rsquo;s social networks, the less biased and more informed groups will become&ndash;even when those groups start off with highly partisan opinions.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We believe that if we are put in a group consisting of like-minded people (so called &ldquo;echo chambers&rdquo;), we probably won&rsquo;t develop ideas that are on the opposite side of the spectrum. However, two social media experiments found the opposite results. In a study, Democrats and Republicans were put into &ldquo;echo chambers&rdquo;, and discussed polarizing issues such as gun control, unemployment rate, and immigration. Both groups ended up moving toward a more moderate view of the topics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In another study, smokers and nonsmokers estimated the risks of cigarette smoking. After the study, both groups had a more accurate understanding of the topic, and a higher opinion of the other group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social media of our time exacerbates rather than eradicates partisan bias, because it&rsquo;s centralized, rather than egalitarian. In a centralized network, influencers filter or even block information. For example, if an influencer spreads a piece of wrong information, it might end up becoming an entrenched false belief in the whole community, whereas in an egalitarian network, each person has an equal say, and ideas are weighed by its own quality rather than the influence of the people behind them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a more complete analysis, the multiverse of data sets could be crossed with the multiverse of models to further reveal the multiverse of statistical results.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is so true. I have several thoughts about this point:</p>
<p>First, it shows how arbitrary the choices in data processing and model picking are, and therefore, how arbitrary the statistical results might be. When I was doing research on selfies, I also had the same feeling. When I was doing the content analysis study comparing the differences in White women&rsquo;s selfies on Twitter and Chinese women&rsquo;s selfies on Weibo, I had to made so many arbitrary choices: whether to drop an item from a construct, whether to combine items, should I use a <em>t</em> test or nonparametric test, etc.</p>
<p>Second, doing multiverse analysis reporting is very methodologically challenging. I cannot imagine a Master student after attending one statistics class doing a project involving more than 200 choice combinations.</p>
<p>Finally, scholars will find it more difficult to cite others' studies. Right now, it&rsquo;s fairly easy to cite because almost all research papers generate a <strong>certain</strong> result. With multiverse analysis, almost all studies will involve many <strong>uncertainties</strong>. This complicates how people interpret the statistical results.</p>
<p>That said, statistics is about <strong>uncertainties</strong>. It&rsquo;s certainly good to show these <strong>uncertainties</strong>. I think the science community, and the public, should be accustomed to seeing <strong>uncertainties</strong> in statistical results in the coming years.</p>

<p>A multiverse analysis is a way to avoid or at least reduce the problem of selective reporting by making the fragility or robustness of the results transparent, and it helps the identification of the most consequential choices.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even when confronted with only one arbitrary data processing choice, researchers should be transparent about it and reveal the sensitivity of the result to this choice.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Increasing transparency in reporting through a multiverse analysis is valuable, regardless of the inferential framework (frequentist or Bayesian), and regardless of the specific way uncertainty is quantified: a <em>p</em> value, an effect size, a confidence (Cumming, 2013) or credibility (Kruschke, 2010) interval, or a Bayes Factor (Morey & Rouder, 2011).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The authors argued that &ldquo;preregistration or blind analysis are not useful strategies for deflating the multiverse&rdquo; (p. 709). I totally agree. I am not familiar with blind analysis, so I&rsquo;ll just talk about preregistration. As the authors noted, even if the study is preregistered, the result is still just one of the many possible choice combinations, albeit preregistered made. Therefore, the results of a preregistered study are still arbitrary, if the research involves arbitrary, or &ldquo;whimsical&rdquo; choices in data construction.</p>
<p>The authors also talked about &ldquo;model multiverse&rdquo; at the end of the article.</p>

<li>Why are two (separate) control conditions needed? Because the percentage (46.8%) of posts containing at least one positive word is much larger than that (22.4%) of posts containing at least one negative word. Suppose that for a person, 10% of his <strong>positive</strong> News Feed is omitted, and there is only <strong>one</strong> control group, what should be the corresponding percentage of a person&rsquo;s <strong>random</strong> News Feed being omitted in this control group? I don&rsquo;t know. Why? For example, if there are three people in experiment A (positivity reduction group), and their content reduction rate is 12%, 13%, and 14% respectively. Accordingly, we assume that the content reduction rate in the control group should be 12% times 46.8%, 13% times 46.8%, and 14% times 46.8%. <strong>No</strong>. Why? Because there is also experiment B, whose content reduction rate might be different than that of experiment A. <strong>Therefore, each experiment needs a separate control condition</strong>.</li>

<p>Correlational studies cannot answer this question since it cannot support causality. Controlled experiments can support causality, but they have these problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exposure is not equal to interaction. In a controlled experiment, mood change might come from interacting with a happy/sad person, rather than simply being exposed to that person&rsquo;s mood;</li>

<ul>
<li>How much less? Good question! According to the authors, &ldquo;each emotional post had between a 10% to 90% change (based on their User ID) of being omitted from their News Feed &mldr;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Well, how do you categorize a post as positive or negative? Awesome question. If a post contains at least one positive word as defined by LIWC2007, then it is a <strong>positive</strong> post. The same is for negative posts.</li>

<li>
<p>Impact factors (IFs): IFs reflect how many times, on average, each paper in a given journal gets cited in the two years following its publication. There are two problems with this measurement: 1) IF is about the journal, not about your paper. Even if your paper is flawed, or even wrong, it&rsquo;s still something you can boast, if it gets published in a top journal; 2) Important findings may receive very few citations within two years since its publication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of citations: 1) People may cite papers simply because of convenience or visibility, not because of the significance of the studies. Many people don&rsquo;t even need to read the papers they cite. 2) Because citations are so important these days, there might be unethical behavior involved. For instance, gatecrashing names by providing a reagent or data without actually participating in the study, or simply by power or authority.</p>

<p>Barriers to women in science remain widely spread worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Main takeaways:</p>
<ul>

<p>In the most productive countries, papers with women in dominant author positions, i.e., sole author, first author, and last author, are cited less than those with men in the same positions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>South America and Eastern Europe had greater gender parity in terms of proportion of authorships.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disciplines dominated by women all have to do with &ldquo;care&rdquo;, for example, nursing; speech, language, and hearing; education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural sciences and humanities are dominated by men. Social sciences had a higher proportion of female authors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;Female collaborations are more domestically oriented than are the collaborations of males from the same country&rdquo; (p. 213)</p>

<p>Major takeaway: Big data research can learn from, and collaborate with small data research, which offers data that is not contained in big data.</p>
<p>I started to think about my selfie studies. Specifically, I looked at 1) whether there are cultural differences between Chinese women&rsquo;s selfies on China&rsquo;s Weibo, and White Women&rsquo;s selfies on Twitter. For example, is it true that Chinese women focus on their face whereas White women focus on their body in their selfies? Do Chinese women&rsquo;s selfies show more cuteness?</p>
<p>I also looked at 2) whether there are gender differences between men&rsquo;s selfies and women&rsquo;s selfies. For example, do women show more self-touching in selfies?</p>
<p>I used a small-data approach. Although I downloaded over 30,000 images from Twitter and 8,000 images from Weibo, I only selected 200 from each platform for analysis, simply because I didn&rsquo;t have that much manpower to analyze them all.</p>
<p>Talking about big data and small data research, I think I can combine the two here. Human content analysis can offer some insights and then directions for big data research. After all, there are so many things to detect in a selfie: the gender of the person, his or her mood, surroundings, posture, facial expressions, etc. Deep learning algorithms need some directions so that they can give us the analysis we need.</p>

<p>Thoughts: Professor Granovetter is right in pointing out that data itself might not help us have a deeper understanding of our society. After all, his seminal paper on &ldquo;weak ties&rdquo; is based on theoretical thinking rather than data.</p>
<p>What are most of the data in research papers used for? To test theories. But theories arise from thinking, not data. Data is limited. It&rsquo;s extremely difficult for most scholars to get high-quality large-scale data. That shouldn&rsquo;t become a barrier to theoretical advances. Scholars who cannot get access to quality data can focus on theoretical thinking.</p>

<p>Homophily is defined as &ldquo;the tendency of social contacts to be similar to one another&rdquo;. Although research on diffusion, and that on social influence differ over the effects of homophily on behavior spreading at the dyadic level, both agree that homophily decreases adoption at the network level. This is because, obviously, the more homophilous one&rsquo;s network is, he is less likely to be exposed to individuals of a different characteristic. If you are a less healthy person, and you find yourself in a homophilous network, it&rsquo;s less likely for you to be aware of what those healthy guys are doing.</p>
<h3 id=purpose>Purpose<a href=#purpose class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<p>To study the effect of homophily on the adoption of healthy behavior</p>
<h3 id=design>Design<a href=#design class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<p>710 participants are randomly put into two conditions: homophilous population condition, and unconstructed population condition. The homophilous population condition consists of people having similar individual characteristics (gender, age, and BMI) whereas people in the other condition are random and mixed.</p>
<p>All networks in the study have the same size (= 72), clustering coefficient (= 0.4), and degree distribution (= 6). The only difference is the level of homophily.</p>
<p>The study consisted of five trials, each having two social networks. All these trials ran at the same time, for seven weeks. The healthy behavior to be adopted is to write a diet diary online.</p>
<p>The seed of the behavior in all networks is a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; individual. At the start of Week 1, the author activated the seed nodes simultaneously. Once an individual signs up, their neighbors will be notified via email.</p>
<h3 id=results-10>Results<a href=#results-10 class=header-anchor arialabel=Anchor> # </a></h3>
<p>Across all five trials, people in homophilous condition had a higher adoption rate than those in unconstructed condition.</p>
<p>Comparing adoption among obese and nonobese individuals: Within homophilous condition, a greater percentage of obese individuals adopted the behavior than that of nonobese people. In unconstructed condition, both the number of and percentage of nonobese adopters were larger than obese adopters. In fact, there was <strong>no</strong> obese adopters in the unconstructed group at all.</p>
<p>Comparing the two conditions: homophily increased the adoption among both the obese and nonobese people.</p>
<p>However, from these results, we cannot say for sure that <strong>homophily</strong> is the reason. For example, it may be that in the homophilous condition, obese people have more neighbors who sign up and thus have more exposure. It may also be because that homophily increases the likelihood for people to sign up once they are exposed. Therefore, we need to compare 1.) <strong>exposure</strong>, and 2.) <strong>the likelihood to adopt once exposed</strong> in the two conditions.</p>
<p>It showed that, <strong>within each of the two conditions</strong>, the percentage of exposed obese people (num. of exposed obese / total num. of obese ppl) and that of exposed nonobese people (num. of exposed nonobese / total num. of nonobese ppl) do not differ significantly. <strong>Across conditions</strong>, homophily significantly increased the percentage of exposed obese people. See Fig. 2D.</p>
<p>How about the likelihood? <strong>within conditions</strong>, the likelihood to adopt after exposure was much higher for the obesed than for the nonobesed. <strong>Acorss conditions</strong>, homophily significantly increased obese people&rsquo;s likelihood to adopt after exposure.</p>
<p>Therefore, homophily increased obese people&rsquo;s <strong>access</strong> to, and the <strong>likelihood</strong> to adopt healthy behavior.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&mldr; low adoption levels of health innovations among less healthy individuals may be a function of social environment rather than a baseline reluctance for adoption.</p>

<li>
<p>The network of sexual partners is a scale-free one, meaning that you cannot assume, for example, 90% of the individuals have 3 - 10 partners. This is simply because there is no inherent scale. It&rsquo;s a crazy world, literally. I cannot believe that there are people who have over 100, even 1000 partners in their lifetime. Isn&rsquo;t this a crazy world?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thanks to this paper, I now know that for a power-law distribution to show a straight line, I need to use CDF (cumulative distribution function)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One thing I didn&rsquo;t understand is how could the authors conclude that &ldquo;the rich get richer&rdquo; by simply looking at Figure 2a? I don&rsquo;t think it is a rigorous remark.</p>

<p>This paper is a little bit too technical for me, especially the second part that involves modeling. Also, I had difficulty understanding the conceptualization of &ldquo;homogeneity&rdquo; and &ldquo;polarization&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Major takeaways from this paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Information on social media quickly reaches in 2 hours around 20% of the people it can reach in the end, and reaches in 5 hours around 40%. This is true for both science and rumors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Science news is usually quickly diffused. However, long-lasting interest doesn&rsquo;t correspond to the size of the interest. This means, even though people keep sharing it, not a lot of people will be interested in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conspiracy rumors diffused slowly and its cascade size is positively correlated with its lifetime. Meaning that the longer it lasts, the more people become interested in it.</p>

<p>The work is indeed significant. It compared the spreading of true and false news on Twitter and concluded that the false spread faster, deeper, and farther than the truth. False political news, in particular, is diffused especially broadly and deeply.</p>
<ul>
<li>Was it because those who spread the false were more influential or active?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not really. Those who spread false news had fewer followers, followed fewer people on Twitter, were less likely to be verified, and had been on Twitter for less time.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Was it because false news was more noval and users are more likely to retweet information with more novelty?</p>
<ul>
<li>False rumors were indeed more novel than the truth;</li>
<li>False news was objectively more novel, but did users get it?
<ul>
<li>Yes, replies to false news showed greater surprise and disgust, whereas the truth inspired more sadness and joy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was it because of selection bias? I mean, the tweets from the six organizations might not be representative of all tweets.</p>
<ul>
<li>The authors verified a second sample of Tweets, which were labeled by three undergraduate students as true, false, or mixed. Again, the results were the same.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Did false news spread faster, deeper, farther, and more broadly because of bot activities? I mean, was it because of bots that crazily retweeted and replied to false news?</p>
<ul>
<li>Two bot-detection algorithms were applied independently to detect and remove bots before data analysis. Results were the same. This has significant implications: that false news traveled faster and farther not because of bots, but because of humans.</li>

<p>Why wasn&rsquo;t it published on <em>Nature</em> or <em>Science</em>: A first look at this paper made me feel that it should have published on <em>Nature</em> or <em>Science</em>. I believe the authors must have tried. After reading the whole paper, I concluded that lack of sufficient evidence might have been the reason why it didn&rsquo;t manage to do so. As the authors have mentioned in their limitations part, there were so many factors other than Twitter that influenced the movement in question, and it was impossible to single them out.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Increasing partisan preferences in the US created a context for fake news to attract huge audiences;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know the exact ratio of fake news against real news, and we don&rsquo;t know the medium-to-long-run effect of exposure to fake news on people&rsquo;s attitudes.</p>

<li>
<p>Bots on social media are hard to detect. Once a detecting technique is developed, bots will upgrade themselves.</p>

<li>
<p>Possible interventions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Encouraging people to use fact checking. However, we are not sure whether this is useful or not, partly due to people&rsquo;s confirmation bias and desirability bias.</li>

<li>Contribution: An experimental design that ran contrary to previous findings regarding the strength of weak ties.</li>
<li>Conclusion: networks with local clustering are conducive to behavioral diffusion.</li>
<li>Method: An experiment with two groups. One group found themselves in a random network, and the other group in a clustered-lattice network. <strong>Degree distribution of the two networks is identical</strong>.</li>
<li>Why could it be published on <em>Science</em>: Maybe the first empirical test of two competing hypotheses regarding the effect of network topology on behavior spreading.</li>
<li>My question: I didn&rsquo;t see many long ties in the &ldquo;small-world network&rdquo; in Figure 1.</li>
<li>Improvements: I didn&rsquo;t know all of the statistical tests used in this paper. I know the Mann-Whitney U test but I don&rsquo;t know Kolmogorov-Smirnov. I am wondering whether the study could be conducted using Bayesian statistics.</li>
