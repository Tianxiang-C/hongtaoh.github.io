At least I didn&amp;rsquo;t.
To understand correlation, we need to first understand covariance. As the name suggests, covariance measures the extent to which two variables covary, i.e., vary together. But the questions are: what does &amp;ldquo;vary&amp;rdquo; mean, and how do we quantify &amp;ldquo;together&amp;rdquo;?
For example, I give you these two vectors:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt a = [2, 4, 6, 8] b = [1, 2, 3, 8] Can you tell me the extent to which they &amp;ldquo;vary together&amp;rdquo;?</description></item></channel></rss>
