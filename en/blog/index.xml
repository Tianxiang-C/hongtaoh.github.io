For example, you have this DOI: 10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030380.
First, you can access this paper, via two urls:

Let&amp;rsquo;s say you want to visualize the ratios between a and b.
Let $a = 10$ and $b = \frac{1}{10}$.
Then, we have
$$\frac{a}{b} = \frac{10}{\frac{1}{10}} = 100 \tag{1}\label{eq1}$$
and
$$\frac{b}{a} = \frac{\frac{1}{10}}{10} = \frac{1}{100} \tag{2}\label{eq2}$$
If you do not use log scale, then the difference between 1 and $\frac{a}{b}$ is much larger than the difference between 1 and $\frac{b}{a}$. However, intuitively, the two difference should be the same, right?</description></item><item><title>Philip Guo's Advice for Early-stage PhD Students</title><link>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2021/09/22/philip-guo-phd-advice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:01:43 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2021/09/22/philip-guo-phd-advice/</guid><description>#1 Stop caring about classes.

Only spend some time on classes when you have made progress on your research. #2 Undergrad versus phd research
Every student admitted into PhD programs has a lot of potential for creative research, but very few of them realize this full potential. The reason is not because they are not smart enough.

To rename a column or columns, you need to use rename , or rename! . The difference is that rename creates a new data frame with the updated name(s) whereas rename! modifies the name(s) in-place.
If you have a lot of columns to rename, it might be better to use a Dict.

This is because without a figure caption, the figure won’t be numbered. Without a number, the figure cannot be referenced.

However, its degree() and degree_distribution() function is not so straightforward. Also, it might be challenging to plot degree distribution.
Getting a deeper understanding of degree() and degree_distribution() To explore these two function, let’s first draw a simple network.

What should we do then?
Click the first row which says &amp;ldquo;Arriving &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, and from there, choose &amp;ldquo;FREE Shipping&amp;rdquo;.
