Take classification tasks as an example. What KNN does is to find K training examples that are &amp;ldquo;closest&amp;rdquo; to the test example. These K training examples have K labels. We find the most common label, and it is the predicted label for the test example in question.
How to quantify &amp;ldquo;closest&amp;rdquo;? Two simple methods are Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance.
I&amp;rsquo;ll take the MNIST dataset as an example.</description></item><item><title>What on Earth is Entropy?</title><link>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/09/21/entropy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Sep 2022 15:33:20 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/09/21/entropy/</guid><description>Rolling a die Imagine you have a 4-sided fair die, with numbers of &amp;lsquo;1&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;2&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;3&amp;rsquo;, and &amp;lsquo;4&amp;rsquo;. You roll the die once and ask your friend, who have his eyes closed, to figure out the outcome. Your friend can ask you any questions, for example, &amp;lsquo;Is the outcome 1?&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Is it below 3?&amp;rsquo;. However, you can only respond with &amp;lsquo;Yes&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;No&amp;rsquo;.
Here is the challenge: which strategy can guarantee that, on average, your friend asks the least number of questions to figure out the outcome?</description></item><item><title>Derivatives of 1/x and square root of x</title><link>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/08/29/two-derivatives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 17:10:40 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/08/29/two-derivatives/</guid><description>1. $y = \frac{1}{x}$ The derivative of $y = \frac{1}{x}$ can be computed in the following way.
First, I highly recommend you to watch this clip , where 3blue1brown visualizes this function.
The key part of the proof is that Since A and B are both on the curve of $y = \frac{1}{x}$, the x coordinate times the y coordinate is 1. That is to say: $A_x \cdot A_y = 1$ and $B_x \cdot B_y = 1$.</description></item><item><title>Why Is Dot Product Defined and Calculated That Way</title><link>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/08/27/dot-product/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 11:34:49 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/08/27/dot-product/</guid><description>Suppose we have:
$$\vec{a} = \begin{bmatrix} a_x \\ a_y \end{bmatrix}$$
$$\vec{b} = \begin{bmatrix} b_x \\ b_y \end{bmatrix}$$
I am wondering why $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = a_x b_x + a_y b_y$.
Let&amp;rsquo;s prove this by having a concrete example:
$$\vec{a} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$$
$$\vec{b} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$$
If you are familiar with linear algebra, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that
$$\vec{a}\cdot \vec{b} = ||\vec{a}||\cdot ||\vec{b}|| \cdot \cos \theta$$</description></item><item><title>Re-understanding Standard Deviation</title><link>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/08/27/std/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Aug 2022 10:41:22 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/08/27/std/</guid><description>The other day I was thinking about the meaning of standard deviation:
$$\sigma = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \bar{x})}{N-1}$$
What is it about? I think it is measuring the expectation of the deviation of a variable from its mean. Then why don&amp;rsquo;t we just measure the absolute deviation: $E|x_i - \bar{x}|$?
I saw this discussion on Stack Overflow and was taken aback by it. Reed&amp;rsquo;s answer was especially inspiring for me. Indeed, if we consider $x_i - \bar{x}$ as a vector in an $N$ dimensional space, then standard deviation is in fact measuring the length of this vector using Euclidean distance whereas the absolute deviation is measuring the length of this vector using Manhattan distance.</description></item><item><title>Explaining and Implementing Hierarchical Clustering</title><link>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/08/24/hier_cluster/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/08/24/hier_cluster/</guid><description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what hierarchical clustering is and how to implement it with Python.

At least I didn&amp;rsquo;t.
To understand correlation, we need to first understand covariance. As the name suggests, covariance measures the extent to which two variables covary, i.e., vary together. But the questions are: what does &amp;ldquo;vary&amp;rdquo; mean, and how do we quantify &amp;ldquo;together&amp;rdquo;?
For example, I give you these two vectors:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt a = [2, 4, 6, 8] b = [1, 2, 3, 8] Can you tell me the extent to which they &amp;ldquo;vary together&amp;rdquo;?</description></item><item><title>Re-Understanding Z Score</title><link>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/08/20/zscore/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hongtaoh.com/en/2022/08/20/zscore/</guid><description>Ask anyone who has attended Stats101 and s/he will tell you that they understand Z-score. But, really? Could you answer the following questions without thinking?
What is the mean of z-scores? What is the standard deviation of z-scores? What is the sum of squared z-scores? Is the z-score distribution the same as the original distribution of sample values? What do z-scores above 0 mean? If you cannot answer them without thinking, then you don&amp;rsquo;t really understand z-scores.</description></item></channel></rss>
